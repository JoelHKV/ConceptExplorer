# Concept Explorer
[Concept Explorer is deployed to GitHub](https://joelhkv.github.io/ConceptExplorer/)

## General Information
Concept Explorer is an application designed for navigating the conceptual world, much like how Google Maps serves as a tool for navigation in the physical realm. Just as physical locations have distances between them, abstract concepts in the conceptual realm also possess a certain degree of separation. This allows users to navigate from one concept to a related concept, facilitating a deeper understanding of the interconnected nature of the conceptual world. Additionally, users have the option to access concise summaries of concepts or explore further details on Wikipedia.
