# Concept Explorer
[Concept Explorer is deployed to GitHub](https://joelhkv.github.io/ConceptExplorer/)

## General Information

Concept Explorer is an educational web app designed to help users 
understand concepts, which are fundamental building blocks in thinking
and understanding. Concept Explorer leverages multifaceted data generated by the AI-powered 
[Concept Generator](https://github.com/JoelHKV/ConceptGenerator/) project project to provide engaging and interactive concept exploration.


## Introduction

Concepts are the foundation of human thinking and understanding. They allow 
us to make sense of the world by organizing information into meaningful 
categories. While we grasp many concepts, our understanding of them is 
often intuitive rather than explicit. For example, explaining what <em>mind</em> 
truly is can be quite challenging.

Concept Explorer helps users explore three crucial aspects of concepts. 
The first aspect is relational. For instance, using Concept Explorer, 
users will quickly discover that <em>mind</em> and <em>consciousness</em> 
are closely related in the <em>conceptual space</em>, similar to 
how <em>Belgium</em> and <em>the Netherlands</em> are closely 
located in <em>physical space</em>.

The second aspect is comparative, i.e., understanding how concepts 
compare to one another across important dimensions. For instance, 
Concept Explorer will promptly demonstrate that <em>supreme being</em> 
is an abstract concept, while <em>stone</em> is a concrete one. 
Comparative understanding is essential, as it helps in adjusting 
the way one thinks and talks about a particular concept 
(e.g., <em>stone</em> can be discussed with a higher degree 
of certainty than <em>supreme being</em>).

Finally, the third aspect is descriptive, i.e., understanding 
how concepts are explained using words and other concepts. 
Concept Explorer provides quick access to concise summaries 
about concepts, as well as links to Wikipedia articles about 
them. Compared to browsing information online, Concept Explorer 
gamifies the learning experience and is, therefore, particularly 
suitable for modern learners whose attention span for searching 
and reading information might be limited.

Concept Explorer is both fun and engaging to use, but its 
ultimate purpose is to enhance one's conceptual thinking skills. 
The app is designed for learners, educators, researchers, 
and anyone curious about the intricacies of human thought.

The multifaceted AI-data the app uses is generated in the 
[Concept Generator](https://github.com/JoelHKV/ConceptGenerator/) project, 
the data and backend-side sister project that powers this app.

## Instructions and Features
### Globe View
Concept Explorer starts with <strong>Globe View</strong>, displaying a Google Map with custom markers representing concepts. You can navigate and zoom the map just like a regular Google Map. Once you find an interesting concept, you can start exploring it by clicking on it. Alternatively, you can click <em>RAND</em> to explore a random concept. If you're not satisfied with the concept you are exploring, simply click <em>GLOBE</em> to return to <strong>Globe View</strong>.

### Browse View
Concept Explorer switches to <strong>Browse View</strong> once a starting concept has been selected. In <strong>Browse View</strong>, the map zooms in and shows the selected concept in the center of the screen, surrounded by eight closely related concepts. You can click on any of these surrounding concepts to make it the new center concept. Alternatively, you can click on the center concept to switch to <strong>Details View</strong> that contains more information about the concept.

### Details View
<strong>Details View</strong> is a popup window that provides a summary of the concept, a link to the corresponding Wikipedia article for further exploration, and a score ranging from 0 to 100, indicating how concrete versus abstract the concept is. This score is also displayed in the middle of the marker in <strong>Browse View</strong>.

## API Keys
### Custom API
Refer [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for details.

### Google Maps
The current version uses a Google Cloud Function to grant access to Google Maps securely. For local use, you can follow these steps:
1) Add the following line to your index.html file:
```
<script src="secret.js"></script>
```
2) Create an additional JavaScript (JS) file named secret.js with the following content:
```
const API_KEY = “YOUR_API_KEY” 
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = API_KEY;
script.async = true;
script.defer = true;
document.head.appendChild(script);
```
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual Google Maps API key.

For more details, you can refer to the [Concept Generator](https://github.com/JoelHKV/ConceptGenerator) project.
## Database Schema
### All Interconnections
Data related to interconnections between concepts is stored in Firestore 
under the following structure:

 - **`conceptBrowser`** (Collection)
    - **`finalConceptData_0`** (Document)
    - **`finalConceptData_1`** (Document)
    - etc
        - **`abstract`** (Number): Rating from 0 (concrete) to 100 (abstract)
        - **`branch`** (Array): The starting concept, its level, ...
        - **`ordered_concepts`** (Array of Strings): An array of the 8 most related concepts to this concept, ordered by relatedness

### Concept Details
Details about individual concepts are stored in Firestore using the following structure:

 - **`conceptNames`** (Collection)
    - **`[CONCEPT NAME]`** (Document)
        - **`definition`** (String): A concise summary (about 70 words) about the concept
        - **`date`** (Timestamp): The date and time when ChatGPT generated the definition
        - **`definition_model_version`** (String): The version of ChatGPT used to generate the definition

Where `CONCEPT NAME` is the name of each concept.

## API Documentation

### Overview
This API allows you to retrieve information about concepts and their interconnections from Firestore using a Google Cloud Function.
### Endpoints

#### Get All Interconnections (GET)
- **URL:** `https://europe-north1-koira-363317.cloudfunctions.net/readConceptsFireStore`
- **Description:** iterates through relevant Firestore documents
(`finalConceptData_0`, `finalConceptData_1`, ...), and returns the combined data in the json format
- **Usage:** Simply make a GET request to the above URL.

#### Get Concept Details (GET)
- **URL:** `https://europe-north1-koira-363317.cloudfunctions.net/readConceptsFireStore?concept_name=ENTER_CONCEPT_NAME_HERE`
- **Description:** Returns details about a specific concept.
- **Usage:** Replace `ENTER_CONCEPT_NAME_HERE` with the desired concept name and make a GET request to the URL.

### Access Restrictions and Usage
To ensure the security and reliability of this API, the cloud function
checks the URL and the IP address of the request. Automatic access is granted
to the URL of the deployed version and the IP address of my own development server.

If you wish to use this API, please don't hesitate to contact the [Project owner](#contact-information).

## Testing

Since Concept Explorer uses Google Map Markers as buttons, but they are not easily 
recognized as such by conventional automated testing tools such as Selenium, 
we use Autohotkey for functional testing. The `SelectAreaAndFireClicks.ahk` 
in the `testing_script` folder is a general-purpose testing script that 
fires random mouse clicks inside a specified rectangular area on the screen.

To use the script, first press the key `s` in the top-left corner of 
the clicking area and then press the key `x` in the bottom-right 
corner of the clicking area. Then, press the key `v` to toggle the 
clicking on and off.

This random clicking test was run with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge (but not Safari).
The screen capture video `Firefox_clicking.mp4` located in the `testing_script` folder is linked 
[here](https://github.com/JoelHKV/ConceptExplorer/tree/main/testing_scripts/Firefox_clicking.mp4)
.
